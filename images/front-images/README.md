# Front images — generic flow / decorative

Generic rocket, plane, and space images with a cool art style. Used **on the sides** of pages (e.g. About Us) as decorative “flow” objects that break up repetition and add visual interest. They are **not** tied to a specific section; the same images can be reused across the site.

**Section-specific imagery** (Networking, Volunteerism, Competitions) lives in `images/about_us/` and is used for each pillar’s main image on the About Us page.

**Current usage on About Us:**  
`rocket_launch.png`, `plane.png`, `satellite_in_space.png`, `three_planes.png` are positioned on the left and right edges. You can swap in other files from this folder (e.g. `parachute_payload.png`, `take_off_scene.png`, `fluid_flow_sim.png`) by editing the `.flow-image` elements in about.html or reusing the `.flow-images` block on other pages.
