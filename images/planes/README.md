# Hero landing plane silhouettes

Add **side-view** plane silhouette images here for the hero “float down and land” animation.

**Expected filenames:** `plane1.png`, `plane2.png`, `plane3.png`  
(You can use `.svg` or `.jpg`; if you do, update the `src` paths in `index.html` for the `.landing` planes.)

These are used by the hero on the home page as planes that drift downward like landings.
